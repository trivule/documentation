# Form Validation

## Global Validation

If you have a website or application and want to apply the same validation rules to all forms without managing each form individually, you can use global validation with [declarative validation](#).

## Usage

To set up global validation, simply initialize Trivule:

```html
<script>
  const tr = new Trivule();
  tr.init();
</script>
```

This activates global validation for all your forms.
Form validation involves validating a set of HTML fields, whether inside a `<form>` element or grouped within a container such as a `<div>`.

## TrivuleForm

TrivuleForm offers two validation approaches: declarative and imperative, to address different form validation needs.

### Declarative Validation

Declarative validation allows validating a form by simply specifying validation rules in the attributes of HTML fields. It's a simple and convenient approach for basic form validation.

Example usage:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <label>Email</label>
    <input type="text" data-tr-rules="required|email|maxlength:32" name="email" />
    <div data-tr-feedback="email"></div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label>Message</label>
    <textarea
      data-tr-rules="required|between:2,250|endWith:."
      name="message"
    ></textarea>
    <div data-tr-feedback="message"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    <button type="submit" value="Submit" data-tr-submit>
      Submit
    </button>
  </p>
</form>
```

Validation initialization:

```js
const trForm = new TrivuleForm("form");
```

With this declarative approach, the form is automatically validated without writing additional JavaScript code, which is ideal for simple form validation needs.

### Imperative Validation

Imperative validation allows defining validation rules and applying them dynamically using JavaScript code. This provides greater flexibility for more complex form validation cases.

Example usage:

```js
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form",{
  realTime:false,
  feedbackSelector:".invalid-feedback"
});
// Define imperative validation rules for each form field
trivuleForm.make([
  {
    selector: "email",
    rules: ["required", "email", "maxlength:32"],
  },
  {
    selector: "message",
    rules: ["required", "between:2,250", "endWith:."],
  },
]);
```

With this imperative approach, you can dynamically define validation rules and interact more actively with the form according to specific needs.

 ### Validation Settings

- To initialize form validation, the first argument passed to the constructor is a CSS selector. It can be a standard `<form>` element or a `<div>` container containing a set of inputs to validate.
- The second parameter consists of a basic configuration to customize the validation behavior.

Here's an explanation of each available option:

- `auto` (optional): This option specifies whether the form should be validated as the user types in the form fields. By default, this option is disabled (`false`).

- `local` (optional): This option allows you to set the language for validation error messages. You can specify the language as a string. For example, `"fr"` for French. This option is also optional.

- `validClass` (optional): This is the CSS class that will be added to all the inputs in the form when they are valid. If this option is not set, no class will be added.

- `invalidClass` (optional): This is the CSS class that will be added to all the inputs in the form when they are invalid. If this option is not set, `is-invalid` class will be added.

Here's the translation:

- `feedbackSelector` (optional): If this option is not specified, Trivule will first check if a selector is indicated during declaration with the `make` method, and then use that selector. In the absence of a selector, Trivule will check if the input has an associated HTML element with the `data-tr-feedback` attribute set to the input's name. If no element is found in either of these cases, no feedback message will be displayed.

- `realTime` (optional): This option specifies whether validation should be performed in real-time as the user types in the form fields. By default, this option is disabled (`false`).

These options allow you to customize the validation of your form according to your specific needs.
**Default values**
```js
const options = {
  auto: true,
  local: {
    lang: "en",
  }; 
  validClass: "",
  invalidClass: "is-invalid",
  feedbackSelector: "[data-tr-feedback={name}]", //where {name} we be replaced with the input name
  realTime: true;
};
```
### Make Validation

The `make` method in the `TrivuleForm` class is used to define and apply validation rules to form inputs. This method allows you to specify validation parameters for multiple inputs, either by passing an array of input parameters or an object containing input names and their corresponding parameters.

#### Usage

The `make` method can be used in two ways:
1. By passing an array of [input parameters](#).
2. By passing an object with input names as keys and their [parameters](#) as values.

#### Example 1: Using an Array of Input Parameters
In this example, we define validation rules for two inputs using an array of input parameters.

```typescript
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form");

// Define validation rules for each form field
trivuleForm.make([
  {
    selector: "age", // The input name
    rules: "required|between:18,40",
  },
  {
    selector: "#birthDayInput", 
    rules: "required|date",
  },
]);
```
#### Example 2: Using an object with input names and parameters

In this example, we define validation rules for multiple inputs using an object where keys are input names and values are their corresponding parameters.

```typescript
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form");

const inputs = {
  age: {
    rules: "required|between:18,40",
  },
  birthDay: {
    rules: "required|date",
    selector: "#birthDayInput",  
  },
  message: {
    rules: "required|only:string",
  },
};

// Apply validation rules
trivuleForm.make(inputs);
```

#### Example 3: Chaining `make` Method Calls

You can also chain multiple `make` method calls to define validation rules for different sets of inputs.

```typescript
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form");

trivuleForm
  .make([
    {
      selector: "age",
      rules: "required|between:18,40",
    },
    {
      selector:"birthDayInput",
      rules: "required|date",
    },
  ])
  .make({
    message: {
      rules: "required|only:string",
    },
  });
```


### Handling Failed Validation

The `TrivuleForm` class offers two approaches for handling failed validation:

**1. Using `onFails` Method:**

* Conveniently attaches an event listener to the `"tr.form.fails"` event.
* Event triggers upon form validation failure.
* Provides a callback function with the `TrivuleForm` instance, enabling access to validation-related information.

**Example:**

```typescript
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form");

trivuleForm.onFails((trivuleForm) => {
  console.log("Form validation failed!", trivuleForm);
  // Additional error handling logic...
});
```

**2. Direct Event Listener:**

* Listen for the `"tr.form.fails"` event directly on the form element.
* Offers more control over event handling.
* Useful when avoiding dependency on `TrivuleForm` methods or for custom event handling needs.

**Example:**

```typescript
const formElement = document.getElementById("form");

formElement.addEventListener("tr.form.fails", (event) => {
  console.log("Form validation failed!", event.target); // Target is the form element
  // Additional error handling logic...
});
```

**Choosing the Approach:**

* **`onFails` Method:** Cleaner and encapsulated when working within the `TrivuleForm` class context.
* **Direct Event Listener:** Offers more control and independence from `TrivuleForm` methods.


### Handling Successful Validation

Similarly to handling failed validation, you can manage successful validation using the `onPasses` method or by directly listening for the `"tr.form.passes"` event.

**1. Using `onPasses` Method:**

* Attach an event listener to the `"tr.form.passes"` event.
* Executed when the form validation succeeds.
* Provides a callback function with the `TrivuleForm` instance, enabling specific actions upon successful validation.

**Example:**

```typescript
const trivuleForm = new TrivuleForm("form");

trivuleForm.onPasses((trivuleForm) => {
  console.log("Form validation passed!", trivuleForm);
  // Additional actions upon successful validation...
});
```

**2. Direct Event Listener:**

* Listen for the `"tr.form.passes"` event directly on the form element.
* Offers more control over event handling and independence from `TrivuleForm` methods.

**Example:**

```typescript
const formElement = document.getElementById("form");

formElement.addEventListener("tr.form.passes", (event) => {
  console.log("Form validation passed!", event.target); // Target is the form element
  // Additional actions upon successful validation...
});
```

**Choosing the Approach:**

* **`onPasses` Method:** Convenient and encapsulated within the `TrivuleForm` class context.
* **Direct Event Listener:** Provides more flexibility and control over event handling.


### Attaching Event Listeners

The `on` method in the `TrivuleForm` class allows you to attach event listeners to the container element of the form.

#### Syntax

```typescript
trivuleForm.on(eventName: string, callback: EventCallback): void;
```

#### Parameters

- `eventName`: A string representing the name of the event to listen to.
- `callback`: The callback function to execute when the specified event occurs. This function takes an event of type `Event` as a parameter and returns nothing.

#### Example

```typescript
// Attach an event listener to handle form initialization
trivuleForm.on("tr.form.init", (event) => {
  console.log("Form initialized", event.detail);
  // Additional actions to perform when the form is initialized
});

 
trivuleForm.on("click", (event) => {
  //form click event
});
```

#### Usage

You can use the `on` method to listen for various events related to the form, such as form initialization, validation, submission, and more. Simply provide the appropriate event name and the corresponding callback function to handle the event.

### Emitting Custom Events

The `emit` method in the `TrivuleForm` class enables you to emit custom events from the container element of the form.

#### Syntax

```typescript
trivuleForm.emit(eventName: string, data?: any): void;
```

#### Parameters

- `eventName`: A string representing the name of the custom event to emit.
- `data` (optional): Additional data to pass along with the event.

#### Example

```typescript
// Emit a custom event to indicate form validation
trivuleForm.emit("tr.form.validate", {
  valid: true,
  message: "Form validation completed successfully",
});
```

#### Usage

You can use the `emit` method to trigger custom events at specific points within your form's lifecycle or in response to certain actions. These events can be listened to and handled elsewhere in your application logic. By emitting custom events, you can create a more modular and flexible architecture for managing form behavior and interactions.

### Handling Form Updates and Validation Events

The `onUpdate` and `onValidate` methods in the `TrivuleForm` class provide powerful event handling capabilities for managing form updates and validation processes.

#### `onUpdate` Method

The `onUpdate` method allows you to attach event listeners that respond to updates in the form inputs. When any input value within the form is updated, the provided callback function is executed.

##### Syntax

```typescript
trivuleForm.onUpdate(callback: TrivuleFormHandler): void;
```

##### Parameters

- `callback`: A callback function to execute when any input value in the form is updated. This function takes the form instance as a parameter.

##### Example

```typescript
trivuleForm.onUpdate((form) => {
  console.log("Form updated", form);
});
```

#### `onValidate` Method

The `onValidate` method allows you to attach event listeners that respond to the validation process of the form. When the form is validated, either manually or automatically, the provided callback function is executed.

##### Syntax

```typescript
trivuleForm.onValidate(callback: TrivuleFormHandler): void;
```

##### Parameters

- `callback`: A callback function to execute when the form is validated. This function takes the form instance as a parameter.

##### Example

```typescript
trivuleForm.onValidate((form) => {
  console.log("Form validated", form);
});
```

#### Usage

You can use the `onUpdate` method to perform actions whenever any input value in the form is updated. This is useful for dynamically responding to changes in form data.

Similarly, the `onValidate` method allows you to execute custom logic when the form undergoes validation. You can use this to handle validation outcomes, update UI elements, or trigger additional processes based on the validation result.

### Iterating Through Form Inputs with the `each` Method

The `each` method in the `TrivuleForm` class facilitates the iteration through all inputs within the form. This method allows you to perform actions or apply logic to each input individually.

### Iterates through each input

The `each` method iterates through each input within the form and executes a callback function for each input.

##### Syntax

```typescript
each(callback: ITrivuleInputCallback<TrivuleInput, any>): void;
```

##### Parameters

- `callback`: A callback function that takes a `TrivuleInput` instance as its parameter. This function will be executed for each input within the form.

##### Example

```typescript
trivuleForm.each((input) => {
  console.log("Input name:", input.getName());
  console.log("Input value:", input.getValue());
  console.log("Input validation status:", input.passes());
});
```

#### Usage

The `each` method is useful when you need to perform operations on each input within the form individually. For example, you can use it to access the name, value, or validation status of each input, apply specific styling or behavior, or trigger custom actions based on input properties.

In this example, we iterate through each input within the `trivuleForm` instance and log their name, value, and validation status. You can replace the callback function with your custom logic to suit your specific requirements, such as updating UI elements, performing calculations, or triggering events based on input properties.



### Managing Inputs in TrivuleForm

In the `TrivuleForm` class, you can interact with individual form inputs through various methods. These methods allow you to retrieve information about inputs, such as their validation status or values.

#### `inputs` Method

The `inputs` method retrieves an array of all inputs within the form. You can specify whether you want strict or non-strict output. In strict mode, you get objects containing only the input name, value, while in non-strict mode, you receive instances of `TrivuleInput`.

##### Syntax

```typescript
inputs(strict?: boolean): ITrivuleInputObject[] | TrivuleInput[];
```

##### Parameters

- `strict`: (Optional) A boolean indicating whether to return strict output (default is `true`).

##### Returns

An array of inputs based on the specified mode.

##### Example

```typescript
// Get all inputs in strict mode
const strictInputs = trivuleForm.inputs(); //return name, value object

// Get all inputs in non-strict mode
const nonStrictInputs = trivuleForm.inputs(false); //Return instances of `TrivuleInput`
```

#### `validated` Method

The `validated` method retrieves an array of inputs that have passed validation. Similar to the `inputs` method, you can specify whether to return strict or non-strict output.

##### Syntax

```typescript
validated(strict?: boolean): ITrivuleInputObject[] | TrivuleInput[];
```

##### Parameters

- `strict`: (Optional) A boolean indicating whether to return strict output (default is `true`).

##### Returns

An array of validated inputs based on the specified mode.

##### Example

```typescript
// Get validated inputs in strict mode
const validatedInputs = trivuleForm.validated();

// Get validated inputs in non-strict mode
const nonStrictValidatedInputs = trivuleForm.validated(false);
```

#### `failed` Method

The `failed` method retrieves an array of inputs that have failed validation. Like the previous methods, you can choose between strict and non-strict output.

##### Syntax

```typescript
failed(strict?: boolean): ITrivuleInputObject[] | TrivuleInput[];
```

##### Parameters

- `strict`: (Optional) A boolean indicating whether to return strict output (default is `true`).

##### Returns

An array of failed inputs based on the specified mode.

##### Example

```typescript
// Get failed inputs in strict mode
const failedInputs = trivuleForm.failed();

// Get failed inputs in non-strict mode
const nonStrictFailedInputs = trivuleForm.failed(false);
```

These methods provide convenient ways to access and manage inputs within the TrivuleForm instance, allowing you to handle validation results effectively and tailor your application's behavior accordingly.


###  Validation status

#### Description
The `isValid()` method determines whether the entire form is currently valid.

#### Syntax
```typescript
isValid(): boolean
```

#### Returns
- A boolean value indicating whether all inputs in the form are currently passing validation.
  - `true`: All inputs are valid.
  - `false`: At least one input is invalid.

#### Example
```typescript
// Check if the form is valid
const isFormValid = trivuleForm.isValid();
if (isFormValid) {
  console.log("The form is valid.");
} else {
  console.log("The form contains invalid inputs.");
}
```
You can also you the `passes()` method or the `valid` property
